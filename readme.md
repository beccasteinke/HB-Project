I plan to create a web app that compiles organizations and companies that offer holistic health and wellness services. I need to either find a database of such things, or create my own based on my own experiences and people I know.

Brain dump of services: cryotherapy, ketamine clinics, crystal grid, Wim Hof, alternative yoga practices, reiki and other body work, biocranial, sound baths, breathwork workshops, feminine energy workshops

I want to include: a map - put in your zip code and it'll pop out a list/map of nearby services within a chosen mileage
		      a method to contact the owner of an offered service - twilio email contacting
		      calendar of events for each company - would also be cool to create a twin cities calendar which includes everything happening
		      blurbs about what these services offer
		      a way to log in - both for providers and users
		      maybe channel some meetup vibes?
		      connected research/wikipedia pages for each service to give the person an overview
